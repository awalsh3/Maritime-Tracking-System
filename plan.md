# Maritime Vessel Tracking Application - Project Plan

## Phase 1: Core Layout and Navigation Structure ✅
- [x] Set up base application layout matching reference design (header with "Inventories Tab", main content grid)
- [x] Implement three-column layout: MAP (left large), Summary tables (center), Filters and Analytics (right)
- [x] Add TIMELINE component at the top
- [x] Create navigation structure and page routing
- [x] Set up responsive grid system for dashboard components

## Phase 2: Interactive Map with Basic Vessel Display ✅
- [x] Install and configure reflex-enterprise for map component
- [x] Implement interactive map component in the left column
- [x] Add sample vessel markers/data points on the map
- [x] Implement map controls (zoom, pan, fly-to features)
- [x] Create vessel data model (type, segment, mmsi, sizeband, location)

## Phase 3: Filter System Implementation ✅
- [x] Build "Reset Filters" button component in top-right
- [x] Implement Vessels Filters panel (Segment, Vessel type, mmsi, Sizeband)
- [x] Create Route Filter panel (Origin Port, Destination Port)
- [x] Add filter state management and event handlers
- [x] Connect filters to vessel display logic (filter vessels on map and tables)

## Phase 4: Summary Tables and Data Display
- [ ] Create "Voyages stats Summary table" component with realistic voyage data
- [ ] Build "Vessel Characteristic Summary" table with vessel specifications
- [ ] Implement "Sequence of events table" at bottom with time-ordered journey data
- [ ] Populate tables with sample maritime data (voyage stats, vessel characteristics, events)
- [ ] Add table styling to match reference design

## Phase 5: Analytics Dashboard with Charts
- [ ] Create "Analytic graphs" section container
- [ ] Implement Stacked Bar chart for energy/fuel consumption (boiler, aux, propulsion)
- [ ] Build "Emissions by Port" chart visualization
- [ ] Create "Emissions by Route" chart component
- [ ] Add "tbd" placeholder chart area
- [ ] Connect chart data to vessel filter selections

## Phase 6: Backend Integration Architecture and Data Flow
- [ ] Set up data service interface layer for Python backend integration
- [ ] Create API endpoint structure for live vessel data ingestion
- [ ] Implement WebSocket support for real-time vessel position updates
- [ ] Add data refresh mechanisms and loading states
- [ ] Create sample data generators for testing complete flow
- [ ] Document integration points for backend data service

---

**Current Goal:** Complete Phase 4 - Summary Tables and Data Display

**Notes:**
- Application uses reflex-enterprise for map component
- Design follows reference image layout strictly
- Filter system successfully filters vessels on map (tested with Deep Sea segment)
- Charts will use recharts library for visualization
- Architecture prepared for real-time data streaming
